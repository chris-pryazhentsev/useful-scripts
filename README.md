Collection of useful PowerShell Scripts to Automate Tedium

This is going to be broken up between scripts written in Python and PowerShell. I'm not going to make this a particularly well organized repo but instead a dumping ground of scripts that I think could be useful to be made available but not particularly important in of themselves.

Most of my time is spent in AWS and Azure so a lot of the concepts in these scripts will be reliant in a cloud-focused environment but it should be fairly simple to go ahead and make these more obvious for your environment as it differs.
